# Webscrapping-Surf-Forecast
Here is a piece of code that allow to web scrape surf forecasts for 16 days for the surf spot of La Marinella (Anglet, French Basque Country) on the surfline 
website (a wolrd class surf forecaster) https://www.surfline.com/surf-report/marinella/584204204e65fad6a7708ff4
I focus myself mainly on surf height (in meters and compared to body size, for exemple overhead or waiste high).
